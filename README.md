## Task 1

**Variant 3**

`Stack implementation with Push, Pop, Peek methods and Count property`

## Task 2

`Write Ñ# CompareVersions() method, which takes as parameters 2 strings. 
These strings are product versions. Product version consists of unlimited versions and subversions. 
Pattern for version is numbers and dot delimiters. 
If first version is greater than second method returns 1, if equals 0, if less -1.
Examples:
str1 = “1.2.3” str2 = “4.5.6” return -1
str1 = “1” str2 = “1.0” return 0
str1 = “1.1.0” str2 = “1.0.1” return 1`

**Task 1 is Stack and StackNode with tests in UnitTests** 

**Task 2 in UnitTests - Function CompareVersions**
